## Reporting a bug

So you've found a bug, and want to help us fix it? Before filing a bug report, please double-check the bug hasn't already been reported. You can do so [on our issue tracker](https://github.com/halo-api/php-halo-api/issues). If something hasn't been raised, you can go ahead and create a new issue with the following information:

* How can the error be reproduced?
* If possible, please also provide an error message or a screenshot to illustrate the problem.

If you want to be really thorough, there is a great overview on Stack Overflow of [what you should consider when reporting a bug](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/240323/how-to-report-bugs-the-smart-way).

It goes without saying that you're welcome to help investigate further and/or find a fix for the bug. If you want to do so, just mention it in your bug report and offer your help!  

## Contributing to an existing issue

### Finding an issue to work on 

We've got a few open issues and are always glad to get help on that front. You can view the list of issues [here](https://github.com/halo-api/php-halo-api/issues). Most of the issues will be labelled, so you can use the labels to get an idea of which issue could be a good fit for you. (Here's [a good article](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/finding-your-first-open-source-project-or-bug-to-work-on-1712f651e5ba) on how to find your first bug to fix).

Before getting to work, take a look at the issue and at the conversation around it. Has someone already offered to work on the issue? Has someone been assigned to the issue? If so, you might want to check with them to see whether they're still actively working on it.

If the issue is a few months old, it might be a good idea to write a short comment to double-check that the issue or feature is still a valid one to jump on.

Feel free to ask for more detail on what is expected: are there any more details or specifications you need to know? 
And if at any point you get stuck: don't hesitate to ask for help.  

### Making your contribution  

We've outlined the contribution workflow [here](#contribution-workflow). If you're a first-timer, don't worry! GitHub has a ton of guides to help you through your first pull request: You can find out more about pull requests [here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) and about creating a pull request [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

## Additional info  

Especially if you're a newcomer to Open Source and you've found some little bumps along the way while contributing, we recommend you write about them. [Here](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/new-contributors-to-open-source-please-blog-more-920af14cffd)'s a great article about why writing about your experience is important; this will encourage other beginners to try their luck at Open Source, too!
